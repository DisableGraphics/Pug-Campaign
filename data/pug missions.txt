            `After having walked around the spaceport for at least 3 hours, asking everything in sight, even the bins, in hope someone or something will pay you at least a bit of attention, a Pug comes to you and asks, with a seemingly annoyed tone: "What does the monkey want?"`

                `   "(Ask him about this galaxy)"`

            `You ask him about this galaxy.`
            `   "I won't give you the answer you want."`

            choice 
                `   "(Ask him again)"`

            `You ask him again`
            `   "Perhaps this little human can't process what I've just said: I won't give you the answer you want."`
            `He then resumes walking as if nothing had happened`
