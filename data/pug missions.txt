            `After having walked around the spaceport for at least 3 hours, asking everything in sight, even the bins, in hope someone or something will pay you at least a bit of attention, a Pug comes to you and asks, with a seemingly annoyed tone: "What does the monkey want?"`

            `You ask him about this galaxy.`

            `You ask him again`

            `Another 3 hours have already passed. You've begun asking even the pebbles in the street due to the desperation. Then, a Pug that looks like he is in charge of a mental hospital asks you: "Is the human alright?"`
            `   "Well yes, I'm only trying to find someone to answer my questions" - You say`
            `   "The human won't receive any answers here. Maybe if he goes to Aghaigh'a Pug he will find something." - he says`

            `As always, you encounter enormous difficulty in finding someone to ask.`
            `However, after only 15 minutes, you are able to ask a random passerby, who says:`
            `   "Ah yes, the galaxy that connects with the wormhole in this system. Humans call it 'Messier 101'."`
            choice
                `   "(What are the Pug doing there?)"`

            `And he walks away`
            `You begin asking yourself why the Pug are so unhelpful`
