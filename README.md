# Pug-Campaign (WIP for now)
A WIP Pug Campaign for <a href=https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky>Endless Sky</a>

# How to play
If you download this plugin, go to a system near Phurad, which can only be accessed by Jump Drive.

# Notice
The objective of this plugin is to be merged with the main game at some point. Please take this into consideration when contributing to this plugin, as all assets should be licensed with a GPLv3-compatible license and the conversations, missions and whatever text thingy you submit may be subject to modifications from me or any of the Endless Sky developers to the point it's almost unrecognizeable from your style.

# Difficulties
- Pugs are expected to sound haughty, poetic and almost passive-aggressive. This is a more complicated style than I've previously anticipated.
- My conversation writing skills are still pretty limited, mainly because I'm not a native English speaker, but rather speak it as a second language. 
- The content must have a rather extensive quality check, as it will probably be merged with the main game at some point.
- I've made a "Pug War Small" fleet that most surely breaks the balance in the game, as it contains Pug Arfectas. I _do_ want to add Pug Arfectas as parts of fleets, but their exclusiveness dies. Maybe if this campaign was available _after_ every single campaign, probably it won't break balance _so_ much.
