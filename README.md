# Pug-Campaign (WIP for now)
A WIP Pug Campaign Plugin for <a href=https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky>Endless Sky</a>

# How to play
If you download this plugin, go to a system near Phurad, which can only be accessed by Jump Drive.

# Hanging around:
-  <a href=https://discord.gg/RQMf3tb7fz> Discord </a>

# Difficulties
- Pugs are expected to sound haughty, poetic and almost passive-aggressive. This is a more complicated style than I've previously anticipated.
- My conversation writing skills are still pretty limited, mainly because I'm not a native English speaker (I make a great deal of errors)

# Acknowledgements
Special thanks to:
- Michael Zahniser & The Endless Sky developers for making such a great game.
- ESA/Hubble for their incredibly detailed galaxy photos.
