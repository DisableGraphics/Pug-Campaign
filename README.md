# Pug-Campaign (WIP for now)
A WIP Pug Campaign for <a href=https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky>Endless Sky</a>

# How to play
If you download this plugin, go to a system near Phurad, which can only be accessed by Jump Drive.

# Notice
The objective of this plugin is to be merged with the main game at some point. Please take this into consideration when contributing to this plugin, as all assets should be licensed under the GPLv3 and the conversations, missions and whatever text thingy you submit may be subject to modifications.

# Difficulties
- Pugs are expected to sound haughty, poetic and almost passive-aggressive.
